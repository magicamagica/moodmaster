# üéµ Mood Master üéµ

Mood Master is a Python application that interacts with the Spotify API to recommend songs based on your current mood. The application also provides features to analyze the mood of your saved tracks and add songs to your Spotify queue. This is a simple hobbyist Python application that uses api calls to get track IDs from Spotify and recognize whether they're happy or sad by analysing the valence value Spotify returns. Made with Spotipy, the Spotify api and a simple tkinter GUI.
